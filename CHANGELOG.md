# Change Log

## Version 3.3.1 (Jan 10, 2017)
Updated README

## Version 3.3.0 (Jan. 6, 2017)
- Added overloaded `Salesforce.retrieve` method to retrieve multiple records in parallel
- Added overloaded `Salesforce.query` method to execute multiple SOQL queries in parallel
- Added overloaded `Salesforce.describe` method to retrieve metadata about multiple Salesforce objects in parallel
- Additional documentation, tests and test coverage

## Version 3.2.0 (Dec. 14, 2016)
- Added Salesforce.describe( ) method, and corresponding [model](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/blob/master/Pod/Classes/Model.swift) structs (ObjectDescription, FieldDescription, PicklistValue) for retrieving [object metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/dome_sobject_describe.htm). (Closes [issue #13](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/issues/13).)
- Additional tests and test coverage

## Version 3.1.1 (Nov. 23, 2016)
Fixed issue #15; removed unneeded `id` parameter in `Salesforce.insert( )` method

## Version 3.1.0 (Nov. 16, 2016)
- Updated `LoginDelegate` to accommodate custom login view controllers and flows. Note: the default [OAuth2 user-agent flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_user_agent_oauth_flow.htm) with the Salesforce-hosted webform is the recommended way to authenticate users; your app shouldn't handle their credentials. Adapted from [@hmuronaka's pull request](https://github.com/mike4aday/SwiftlySalesforce/pull/14).
- Deprecated `LoginDelegate` extension method `handleRedirectURL(redirectURL: URL)` in favor of `handleRedirectURL(url: URL)`.

## Version 3.0.1 (Oct. 27, 2016)
Added file "OAuth2.plist" which is used for testing the framework. If you run the tests, edit the file and insert your own values for the Salesforce access token, refresh token, etc. 

## Version 3.0.0 (Oct. 25, 2016)
(This is a ‘breaking’ change that is not compatible with prior versions)
- Upgrade for Swift 3
- Lots of enhancements to make building native iOS apps on Salesforce even easier - see the [README](./README.md)

## Version 2.2.0 (Oct. 24, 2016)
